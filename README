echo "# Opsystem" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://
git push -u origin main

â€¦or push an existing repository from the command line
git remote add origin https://github.com
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

Probably you did not fetch the remote changes before the rebase or someone pushed new changes (while you were rebasing and trying to push). Try these steps:

#fetching remote 'feature/my_feature_branch' branch to the 'tmp' local branch
git fetch origin feature/my_feature_branch:tmp

#rebasing on local 'tmp' branch
git rebase tmp

#pushing local changes to the remote
git push origin HEAD:feature/my_feature_branch

#removing temporary created 'tmp' branch
git branch -D tmp
